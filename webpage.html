    <h1>GitHub API - How-To Guide</h1>
    <h1>Issues</h1>
    https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/
    <!-- Displaying all issues -->
    <h2>All Issues</h2>
      <p>
        All issues for a GitHub repository can be fetched via a GET request
        using the GitHub API. The repository must be publically accessible.
        To retrieve all of the issues for a repository, a get request to 
        <code>/repos/:owner/:repo/issues</code> is made, where <code>:owner</code>
        is the owner of the repository and <code>:repo</code> is the repository.
        This returns a JSON array where each element represents an issue.          
      </p>
      <p>
        Each element contains information about the issue such as milestones
        attached, the state of the issue (open, closed, or all), and more.
        Obviously, it also contains the title of the issue, the issue description,
        and any comments that have been made about the issue.
      </p>
      <p>Below is asynchronous Javascript that can be used to request all of the
        issues for a repository. 
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        function getAllIssues(){
          var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
          var url = ' https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/issues' 
          req.open('GET', url, true);
          req.addEventListener('load',function(){
            if(req.status >= 200 && req.status < 400){
              var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
              parseAllIssues(response);
            } else {
              parseAllIssues(null);
            }});
          req.send(null);
        }
        
        function parseAllIssues(issues){
          if(issues.length == 0){
            // The repository has no issues
          } else if(issues === null){
            // Something went wrong.
          } else{
            issues.forEach(function (issue, i) {
              // Use the issue's information
            });
          }
        }
      </code></pre>
      
    Click the "submit" button to see this code in action and see all of the 
    issues for the repository that contains this site's code.  
    <br>
    <input type="submit" id="getAllIssues">
    <div id="allIssues"></div>

    <!-- Displaying single issues -->
    <h2>Individual Issues</h2>
      <p>
        Individual issues for a repository can be retrieved as well. These are
        accessed in the same manner as all issues from the repository, except
        that <code>:number</code>, which is the issue's number, is appended to 
        the request url. If the requested number for an issue does not exist, 
        a "Not Found" message is returned. 
      </p>
      <p>Below is example code for requesting a single issue from the repository
        that contains this site's code.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        function getAllIssues(){
          var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
          var url = ' https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:number' 
          req.open('GET', url, true);
          req.addEventListener('load',function(){
            if(req.status >= 200 && req.status < 400){
              var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
              parseIssues(response);
            } else {
              parseIssues(null);
            }});
          req.send(null);
        }
        
        function parseIssue(issue){
          if(issue === null){
            // Something went wrong.
          } else{
            // Use the issue's information
          }
        }
      </code></pre>
      Select a number and click the "submit" button to retrieve a single 
      issue from the test repository.
    <form>
      <input type="number" id='enteredIssueNum' min="1" size="5">
      <input type="submit" id="getOneIssue">
    </form>
    <div id="singleIssue"></div>
    
    <h3>More GitHub Issue Features</h3>
    <p>The GitHub API supports many more issue features, such as 
      creating, editing, locking, and unlocking issues. These features 
      are all accessed in the same way as the previous examples. The 
      GET urls that are used to retrieve this data can be found in the 
      GitHub API documentation. 
    </p>

    <h2>Repository Code-Base</h2>
    <h3>Get a File From a Repository</h3>
    https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#get-contents
      <p>
      The GitHub API allows code to be fetched from a public repository
      through GET requests. A single file from a repository can be 
      retrieved by accessing the 
      <code>/repos/:owner/:repo/contents/:filepath</code>. 
      Information about the file is sent in the response, as well as 
      the file contents sent in base64 encoding. This needs to be decoded 
      using a base64 decoder, such as <code>atob()</code>. 
      </p>
      <p>Below is example code that will retrieve a file from a repo
        with an asynchronous Javascript GET request.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        function getAllIssues(){
          var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
          var url = ' https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/coontents/:filepath' 
          req.open('GET', url, true);
          req.addEventListener('load',function(){
            if(req.status >= 200 && req.status < 400){
              var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
              parseFile(response);
            } else {
              parseFile(null);
            }});
          req.send(null);
        }
        
        function parseFile(file){
          if(issue === null){
            // Something went wrong.
          } else{
            // Use the issue's information
            // the contents of the file are encoded in base64.
            var code = atob(file.content);
          }
        }
      </code></pre>
      Enter the name of a file (or use the default value) to retrieve 
      it from the repo that the code for this site is contained in.
    <form>
      <input type="text" id='filename' placeholder="issues.js" value="issues.js">
      <input type="submit" id="getOneFile">
    </form>
    <div id="singleFile"></div>
    
    
    <h3>More Repository Contents Features</h3>
    <p>
      The GitHub API allows one to do much more with the contents of a
      repository. the API allows one to perform nearly any operation 
      supported by GitHub, such as creating, updating, and deleting files,
      which is very useful for the many GitHub plugins that provide useful
      repository features. Many of these features require authentication 
      because of the private nature of much of GitHub's contents. This
      authentication can be provided in several different ways, which
      can be found on the authentication page of the GitHub API 
      documentation. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The GitHub API provides an immense amount of functionality for
      anyone to use, which has allowed a large number of programmers
      to provide useful plug-ins, add-ons, and external sites that
      make software development using git much cleaner and easier to
      manage. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the expansiveness of the GitHub API and the functionality 
      that it provides, this how-to guide is only able to provide a brief
      introduction to a couple of the features of the GitHub API and how 
      to use it via Javascript in a browser. It provides many more features 
      than those that are shown here from creating pull requests and searching 
      a repo, to retrieving all of the emojis that GitHub supports.
