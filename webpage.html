    <h1>GitHub API - How-To Guide</h1>
    <h1>Issues</h1>
    https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/
    <!-- Displaying all issues -->
    <h2>All Issues</h2>
      <p>
        All issues for a GitHub repository can be fetched via a GET request
        using the GitHub API. The repository must be publically accessible.
        To retrieve all of the issues for a repository, a get request to 
        <code>/repos/:owner/:repo/issues</code> is made, where <code>:owner</code>
        is the owner of the repository and <code>:repo</code> is the repository.
        This returns a JSON array where each element represents an issue.          
      </p>
      <p>
        Each element contains information about the issue such as milestones
        attached, the state of the issue (open, closed, or all), and more.
        Obviously, it also contains the title of the issue, the issue description,
        and any comments that have been made about the issue.
      </p>
      <p>Below is asynchronous Javascript that can be used to request all of the
        issues for a repository.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        TODO: Put some code here
      </code></pre>
    Click the "submit" button to see this code in action and see all of the 
    issues for the repository that contains this site's code.  
    <input type="submit" id="getAllIssues">
    <div id="allIssues"></div>

    <!-- Displaying single issues -->
    <h2>Individual Issues</h2>
      <p>
        Individual issues for a repository can be retrieved as well. These are
        accessed in the same manner as all issues from the repository, except
        that <code>:number</code>, which is the issue's number, is appended to 
        the request url. If the requested number for an issue does not exist, 
        a "Not Found" message is returned. 
      </p>
      <p>Below is example code for requesting a single issue from the repository
        that contains this site's code.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        TODO: Put some code here
      </code></pre>
      Select a number and click the "submit" button to retrieve a single 
      issue from the test repository.
    <form>
      <input type="number" id='enteredIssueNum' min="1" size="5">
      <input type="submit" id="getOneIssue">
    </form>
    <div id="singleIssue"></div>
    
    <h3>More GitHub Issue Features</h3>
    <p>The GitHub API supports many more issue features, such as 
      creating, editing, locking, and unlocking issues. 
    </p>

    <h2>Repository Code-Base</h2>
    <h3>Get a File From a Repository</h3>
    https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#get-contents
      <p>
      The GitHub API allows code to be fetched from a public repository
      through GET requests. A single file from a repository can be 
      retrieved by accessing the 
      <code>/repos/:owner/:repo/contents/:filepath</code>. 
      Information about the file is sent in the response, as well as 
      the file contents sent in base64 encoding. This needs to be decoded 
      using a base64 decoder, such as <code>atob()</code>. 
      </p>
      <p>Below is example code that will retrieve a file from a repo
        with an asynchronous Javascript GET request.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        TODO: Put some code here
      </code></pre>
      Enter the name of a file (or use the default value) to retrieve 
      it from the repo that the code for this site is contained in.
    <form>
      <input type="text" id='filename' placeholder="issues.js" value="issues.js">
      <input type="submit" id="getOneFile">
    </form>
    <div id="singleFile"></div>
    </div>
    
    
    <h3>More Repository Contents Features</h3>
    <p>
      The GitHub API allows one to do much more with the contents of a
      repository. TODO SAY MORE HERE
